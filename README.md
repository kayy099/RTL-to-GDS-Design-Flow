# RTL-to-GDS-Design-Flow
Implemented VLSI Design Flow -  RTL to GDS Synthesis of a 2x2 Network on Chip using Cadence and Synopsys tools.
Wrote and simulated RTL code, generated a code coverage report, and synthesized the design to produce a netlist. Generated area, power, and timing reports. Performed STA, logical equivalence checking, and inserted scan chains for DFT analysis. Executed floorplanning with core utilization of 0.5 and 0.8, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, power analysis, and final GDS generation.
